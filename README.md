## About the game
We made a dungeon crawler like game in which our protagonist is Tete, a young (and bald) man who was playing football with his friends but their ball got into the dungeon so Tete was the chosen one to go find it.

## How to play
Use the `Joystick` to move your character around the map.

Press `A button` once you unlock the football to shoot your enemies with a kick attack.

## Levels walkthrough
### First floor
Tete appears in a mysterious room, the only word that resonates in his mind is LEVER, he must walk through this cryptid room and find the lever that will allow him to move to the following room.

### Second floor
After exiting the first room he finds himself in another old and musty room, where he finds his beloved football and now he must find the two levers, one that will unlock the first bridge to the second segment of the room and the second one that will free his path to the third and final room.

### Arena floor
Tete is so close to getting out of this mess, he must now fight through an arena of enemies while beeing booed by a huge crowd to unlock his exit and finally reclaim his freedom!

## Enemies
### Poopy
Poopy is a conglomeration of excrement that gained sentience after Tete appeared in the dungeon. Its behavior consists of following Tete across the room, regardless of his location. It has a medium speed (20) and will perish upon contact with Tete, dealing one heart of damage.

### Yellow Card
Yellow Card is one of Tete's major adversaries in the real world, having now materialized into a monster. In the first stage of its appearance, it moves up and down with high speed (60). Similar to Poopy, it will die upon contact with Tete, causing one heart of damage.

### Red Card
Red Card is the most formidable enemy Tete will encounter, both in the real world and in the dungeon. In the initial stage of its appearance, it remains stationary until it spots Tete, at which point it charges with extreme speed (80). Like the other enemies, it will die upon contact with Tete and inflicts one heart of damage.
